# 📊 Data Science Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Data Science Learning Repository**! 🚀  
This repo is a collection of small, hands-on projects I built while learning data science and machine learning concepts.  
Each notebook focuses on **one key idea** — from regression and clustering to classification and market segmentation — with practical examples and datasets included.  

---

## 🔎 What’s Inside?

- **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)** → Step-by-step code with explanations and visualizations.  
- **Python Scripts (`.py`)** → Standalone implementations (e.g., regression).  
- **Datasets (`.csv`)** → Real-world and practice datasets to experiment with.  

### 📂 Highlighted Notebooks
- 🧩 **Clustering**
  - `Basics_of_Clustering.ipynb`
  - `Cluster_analysis_Dendogram.ipynb`
  - `Clustering_Categorical.ipynb`
- 📈 **Regression**
  - `SimpleLinearModelSklearn.ipynb`
  - `MultipleLinearModelSkelearn.ipynb`
  - `Linear_regresssion_prac_exa.ipynb`
  - `First_Regression.py`
- ✅ **Classification**
  - `Basics_of_logistic.ipynb`
- 🛒 **Market Analysis**
  - `Market_sagment.ipynb`
